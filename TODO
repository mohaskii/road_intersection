# TODO

## Modules

### shapes Module
- [ ] Create functions to draw geometric shapes like lines and rectangles.
- [ ] Implement functions to represent roads and intersections.

### map Module
- [ ] Develop functions to construct the map using shapes defined in the shapes module.
- [ ] Ensure that the map construction aligns with the project requirements.

### traffic_light Module
- [ ] Design a structure to represent traffic lights and their states.
- [ ] Implement logic to toggle between red and green lights.
- [ ] Integrate traffic light functionality with the map module.

### transport Module
- [ ] Define a structure to represent vehicles and their attributes (position, velocity, color, etc.).
- [ ] Implement methods for vehicle movement, stopping, and auto-destruction.
- [ ] Ensure that vehicles follow the rules specified in the project requirements.

### driver Module
- [ ] Develop functions to handle user input for creating vehicles and controlling the simulation.
- [ ] Implement command parsing and execution for user interactions.
- [ ] Ensure that user commands align with the project specifications.

## General
- [ ] Integrate modules to create a cohesive simulation environment.
- [ ] Implement collision detection between vehicles.
- [ ] Test the simulation to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the project objectives.
- [ ] Add error handling and edge case considerations throughout the code.
- [ ] Document code thoroughly, including function descriptions and module usage.
- [ ] Optimize performance and efficiency of the simulation.
- [ ] Consider optional features such as vehicle and traffic light animations, and implement if time permits.

## Documentation and Communication
- [ ] Update README.md with a project overview, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- [ ] Hold regular team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- [ ] Document decisions and discussions to maintain clarity and transparency within the team.
- [ ] Provide feedback and support to team members as needed.
- [ ] Review and refine the codebase based on feedback and testing results.
